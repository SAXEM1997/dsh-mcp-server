/**
 * The lock is the only thing standing between two writers and a lost update, and
 * three separate rounds of review found it broken in a different way each time:
 *
 * 1. it reclaimed "stale" locks by age alone, so a slow-but-alive holder was
 *    robbed, and the victim's release then deleted the thief's lock — a third
 *    writer walked straight in while the second was still working;
 * 2. it waited less than the slowest legitimate hold, so ordinary concurrency
 *    turned into a 500;
 * 3. a failed unlink of a stale lock looped without ever re-checking the
 *    deadline, so one wedged lock hung every later save.
 *
 * Run: node test/tool-scope-lock-test.mjs
